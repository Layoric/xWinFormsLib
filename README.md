xWinFormsLib
============

##Overview of changes
This project adds a XML markup to generate the xWinForms controls. I've added an schema file to give intellisense within Visual studio for valid markup. This should make designing Winform like interfaces a bit nicer and simpler. For eg, the follow markup would generate the screen shot below.


One all the controls are included in the schema, events will be added.
